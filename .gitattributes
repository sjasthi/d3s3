# 1. Handle all files as text by default and normalize to LF in the repo
* text=auto

# 2. Explicitly force LF for specific web/code files (best for PHP/Linux)
*.php text eol=lf
*.js text eol=lf
*.css text eol=lf

# 3. Explicitly handle Markdown and other documentation
*.md text eol=lf
*.txt text

# 4. Protect binary files from being corrupted by line ending changes
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.pdf binary
